# Hand Gesture Cricket: A Duel of Digital Cricket Magic 🪄🏏✨

Welcome to the enchanting world of Hand Gesture Cricket, my captivating creation for the ES102 Course! In this project, you'll step onto the digital pitch for a thrilling showdown against a formidable computer opponent.

## Unveiling the Magic ✨

1. **Dream Teams:** Assemble your dream team with 5 exceptional players, including yourself, ready to wield the magic of hand gestures.

2. **Power of Choice:** Prepare to cast your spells, as both you and the computer must conjure an integer between 0 and 6 before each mystical play.

3. **The Alchemy of Runs:** Watch as the magic unfolds! When your choice aligns with the computer's incantation, the batsman is mystically dismissed. Divergent choices, on the other hand, weave a spellbinding tale of runs for the batsman.

4. **A Grand Finale:** Only the wizardry of victory can crown the ultimate sorcerer of this mystical duel.

5. **Crystal Ball Scoreboard:** Gaze into the crystal ball at any moment to reveal the enchanting scoreboard by invoking the same incantation.

6. **Wizard's Wide:** When you wield the ball, don't forget your 'wide' spell, a secret weapon to keep the competition on their toes.

7. **Magical Validation:** Fear not, for if your incantation falters and you utter an arcane, forbidden phrase, the game shall gently remind you of the proper spell without halting the mystical journey.

8. **The Chronicles:** After the grand finale, witness the unveiling of comprehensive statistics, reminiscent of legendary international cricket matches, etching your name into the annals of cricketing history.

Prepare to be enchanted, enthralled, and entertained as you embark on this extraordinary journey of Hand Gesture Cricket! 🪄🏏✨
