# Hand Gesture Cricket

Welcome to my ES102 Course project - Hand Gesture Cricket! In this project, you'll take on the computer in an engaging game of hand gesture cricket.

## General Rules

1. Teams: Each team consists of 5 players, including yourself and the computer.

2. Batting Choices: Both you and the computer will select an integer between 0 and 6 before each play.

3. Scoring: If your choice matches the computer's choice, the batsman is given out. Otherwise, both choices count as runs for the batsman.

4. Victory: The player who wins the game is declared the overall winner.

5. Scoreboard: You can check the scoreboard at any time by entering the same command.

6. Bowling: During your turn to bowl, you can also input 'wide' to register a wide ball.

7. Input Validation: If you enter an invalid input, the game will politely notify you of the incorrect input without disrupting the game.

8. Statistics: At the conclusion of the game, comprehensive statistics akin to international cricket matches will be displayed.

Get ready for a fun and immersive Hand Gesture Cricket experience!

**Enjoy the game and have a great time playing!**
